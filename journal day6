I don't have anything positive to say about any of this right now. This assignment is due before school starts, and I don't have faith right now that I'll get to this before school starts, so I'm turning this is after 11pm. I'm frustrated. Today I learned that the teachers really want to us to be successful. Today I learned that the first week of 201 was taught with a 401 approach. Today I learned that others are struggling also. Today I learned that the syntax is harder than the concepts.
